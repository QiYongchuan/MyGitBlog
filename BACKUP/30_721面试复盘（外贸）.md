# [721面试复盘（外贸）](https://github.com/QiYongchuan/MyGitBlog/issues/30)

7.21下午，面试外贸员实习生岗位，趁着记忆新鲜赶紧写一写。

问题：
1.你之前是农业，现在是计算机专业，现在为什么想做外贸销售的工作？
2.什么时候可以入职？
3.英语听说读写能力怎么样？
4.有没有在YouTube等剪过视频，（有没有接触过YouTube、twtter等）

英文问答：
1.介绍一下你目前的情况，兴趣爱好等
2.你为什么想加入这个公司，你的目标和愿景是什么？

上面两个问题，都能听懂，但是表达很吃力。第一个照着GitHub的介绍念的，第二个竟然回答，我想练习口语（啊啊啊啊）

总的来说，算是迈出了第一步，能带来一点安慰的是，英语倒是能听到，有以及中文的问题回答的还算勉强，不算很磕磕绊绊，对于过去运营的经历还算自信的说出。【在选择职位时，运营可能更适合我自身的条件一点，但是想的是找一个更有挑战性一点更好玩一点的职位，就投了外贸实习生】

最后面试官安慰说表现还可以，问了能不能住在学校里，以及能实习多久的问题，说目前暑假已经过半，目前的实习生还挺多，就让等通知了。

不知道能不能通过了，通过就买票去武汉实习，不行就再考虑别的打算了。

需要加强的是英语口语，至少准备一下自我介绍以及为什么加入公司的表达了。
